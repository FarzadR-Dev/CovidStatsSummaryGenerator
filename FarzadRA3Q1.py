"""
I/O Question: Find a data set you are interested in. (If stuck,
go to Environment Canada or U of W weather stats and
download something.) The data set must have at least 100
rows and 10 columns. (or 200 rows and 5 columns). Ask if
your data does not comply before proceeding. Create a
flowchart and IPO chart, then write a program that reads in
your txt or csv or xml file and writes out a summary file
containing averages &amp;/or max and min values for the data set
and whatever other total information is relevant. (Level 3) Additional relevant
stats for a level 4. {IE: Snowfall is not relevant in the summer months if using
weather so an average is fine but does not give a true picture.} You are all
intelligent, Iâ€™m sure you can determine what is meaningful and above
expectations for your dataset. Have fun with this. Also, make absolutely sure
you Push the data file to me in GitHub!
